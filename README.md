# The Random Bot

This is the repository for the Random Bot. It was originally written in Python, but we made it when we really had no
idea what we were doing, so we decided to rewrite it in Rust using the poise library which is a wrapper of serenity-rs.

## Building

You need cargo and it should automatically install the crates on the first run. Run `cargo run` in the root repository.

## Parity

Parity with the Python version right now is about `30%`
